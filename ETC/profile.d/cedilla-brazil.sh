# The desired behavior when typing in certain languages is that
# '+c results in the รง character, and not ฤ. In Portuguese this
# can be achieved by setting LC_CTYPE to pt_BR.UTF-8.

# When the selected display language is Brazilian Portuguese,
# LC_CTYPE inherits the desired value from LANG. Due to this
# file, setting the Regional Formats value to Brazilian Portuguese
# is sufficient to enable the just mentioned desired behavior,
# even if the display language is something else but Brazilian
# Portuguese.
